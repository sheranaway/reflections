When would you want to use a remote repository rather 
than keeping all your work local?

It would be better to keep a reporsitory that contains 
materials from a collaborative project remote so that 
every contributor can keep adding their changes without
depending on other users, and other users can obtain 
said changes as they need. Local repositories would work 
better for single-contributor projects.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually 
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with 
your remote repository?

Manual pull let's users pull chages only when they need, 
so they don't accidentally combine parts that they don't 
need or that will interfere with their purpose. If pulls 
were automatic, it would cause a lot of confusion, and in
most cases, make the code unusable for the user.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and 
branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches -  are different off-shoots of code history that 
have a common commit ancestor. They are useful when 
exploring new ideas that fall within the same general 
concept, or are expansions of a single part of a project.
Clones - are copies of git repostories, either of a remote 
repo, or one hosted on the same computer. They can be used 
to maintain and work on our versions of a project locally,
and then combined with the original as required and through
the repo owners permission.
Forks - are clones that apply only on the GitHub website. 
Tey allow us to maintain a copy of another repo on our own 
GitHub page, which copy can be clones to our local machine 
to provide an automatic remote that would push/pull from our 
copy on GitHub rather tha disturbing the original. Similar to
clones, they can be used to maintain and work on our own 
version of a project and combined with the original, but with
the bonus that it is hosted on GitHub and so can be shared 
readily, and other users can be given access directly through
Github.
