When would you want to use a remote repository rather 
than keeping all your work local?

It would be better to keep a reporsitory that contains 
materials from a collaborative project remote so that 
every contributor can keep adding their changes without
depending on other users, and other users can obtain 
said changes as they need. Local repositories would work 
better for single-contributor projects.
