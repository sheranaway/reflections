When would you want to use a remote repository rather 
than keeping all your work local?

It would be better to keep a reporsitory that contains 
materials from a collaborative project remote so that 
every contributor can keep adding their changes without
depending on other users, and other users can obtain 
said changes as they need. Local repositories would work 
better for single-contributor projects.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually 
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with 
your remote repository?

Manual pull let's users pull chages only when they need, 
so they don't accidentally combine parts that they don't 
need or that will interfere with their purpose. If pulls 
were automatic, it would cause a lot of confusion, and in
most cases, make the code unusable for the user.
