What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?

a .git file is created in the folder of the repo, 
which maintains details of the repository's 
history. Thus, a normal directory gets converted 
to a git repository that can be committed as 
required.
Inititalization is required in order to change 
our folders from regular directories to git repo's 
that can be committed and tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working 
directory and the repository? What value do you 
think it offers?

Repository is the collection of files being 
definitively tracked, whereas working directory is
the directory we are currently positioned in through 
Git Bash. The staging area is the intermediate area 
where any files that need to be committed are added 
before the final commit takes place. In this way, it 
offers a place to check the files we want to commit 
before they are added to the repo for tracking.
